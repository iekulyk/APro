Wideband Delphi is a structured group-estimation technique. The original Delphi technique was developed by the Rand Corporation in the late 1940s for use in predicting trends in technology (Boehm 1981). The name Delphi comes from the ancient Greek oracle at Delphi. The basic Delphi technique called for several experts to create independent estimates and then to meet for as long as necessary to converge on, or at least agree upon, a single estimate.

####Wideband Delphi Technique

  - The Delphi coordinator presents each estimator with the specification and an estimation form
  - Estimators prepare initial estimates individually. (Optionally, this step can be preformed after step 3.)
  - The coordinator calls a group meeting in which the estimators discuss estimation issues related to the project at hand. If the group agrees on a single estimate without much discussion, the coordinator assigns someone to play devil's advocate.
  - Estimators give their individual estimates to the coordinator anonymously.
  - The coordinator prepares a summary of the estimates on an iteration form and presents the iteration form to the estimators so that they can see how their estimates compare with other estimators' estimates.
  - The coordinator has estimators meet to discuss variations in their estimates.
  - Estimators vote anonymously on whether they want to accept the average estimate. If any of the estimators votes "no," they return to step 3.
  - The final estimate is the single-point estimate stemming from the Delphi exercise. Or, the final estimate is the range created through the Delphi discussion and the single-point Delphi estimate is the expected case.

####When to Use Wideband Delphi

In the difficult group estimation exercise I've discussed in this chapter, Wideband Delphi reduced the average estimation error from 290% to 170%. Errors of 290% and 170% are very high, characteristic of estimates created in the wide part of the Cone of Uncertainty. Still, reducing error by 40% is valuable, whether the reduction is from 290% to 170% or from 50% to 30%.

Although my data seems to endorse the use of Wideband Delphi, industry studies on the question of how to combine estimates created by different estimators have been mixed. Some studies have found that group-based approaches to combining estimates work best, and others have found that simple averaging works best (JÃ¸rgensen 2002).

Because Wideband Delphi requires a meeting, it burns a lot of staff time, making it an expensive way to estimate. It is not appropriate for detailed task estimates.

Wideband Delphi is useful if you're estimating work in a new business area, work in a new technology, or work for a brand-new kind of software. It is useful for creating "order of magnitude" estimates at product definition or software concept time, before you've pinned down many of the requirements. It's also useful if a project will draw heavily from diverse specialties, such as a combined need for uncommon usability, algorithmic complexity, exceptional performance, intricate business rules, and so on. It also tends to sharpen the definition of the scope of work, and it's useful for flushing out estimation assumptions. In short, Wideband Delphi is most useful for estimating single, focused items that require input from numerous disciplines in the very wide part of the Cone of Uncertainty. In these uncertain situations, Wideband Delphi can be invaluable.

 Tip #63  Use Wideband Delphi for early-in-the-project estimates, for unfamiliar systems, and when several diverse disciplines will be involved in the project itself.
