Cone of Uncertainty

![Cone](https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/dynimg/IC558583.png)

The cone demonstrates that we have the most uncertainty at the beginning of any project (a variance of 4x to 0.25x in range). This variance means that what we estimate to be a one-year project could actually end up taking anywhere from 3 to 48 months. The beginning of any project is the time when we are the least certain about the project, yet it is also when we are asked to deliver estimates that are very precise.
In agile, we try to move from uncertainty to certainty in as short a cycle as possible. This is accomplished by maximizing early learning about the system and how it should be designed. To do this, we create a single path through the system, a complete and working story. We use this to flush out design and requirement assumptions early, which allows us to move to certainty much more quickly and with much more confidence.

As you make a greater percentage of those decisions, you reduce the estimation uncertainty.

An important—and difficult—concept is that the Cone of Uncertainty represents the best-case accuracy that is possible to have in software estimates at different points in a project. The Cone represents the error in estimates created by skilled estimators. It's easily possible to do worse. It isn't possible to be more accurate; it's only possible to be more lucky

The Cone narrows only as you make decisions that eliminate variability

defining the product vision (including committing to what you will not do) reduces variability. Defining requirements—again, including what you are not going to do—eliminates variability further. Designing the user interface helps to reduce the risk of variability arising from misunderstood requirements. Of course, if the product isn't really defined, or if the product definition gets redefined later, the Cone will widen, and estimation accuracy will be poorer.
