Challenges with Estimating Schedule
---

The need to meet customer deadlines, trade show deadlines, seasonal sales-cycle deadlines, regulatory deadlines, and other calendar-oriented deadlines seems to put much of the estimation pressure on the schedule. The schedule estimate seems to produce most of the heat in estimation discussions.

Ironically, once you move from intuitive estimation approaches to approaches based on historical data, the schedule estimate becomes a simple computation that flows from the size and effort estimates. If T.S. Eliot had written poems about software, he might have written

This is the way the estimate ends 

This is the way the estimate ends 

This is the way the estimate ends 

Not with a bang but a whimper 


The Basic Schedule Equation
---

A rule of thumb is that you can estimate schedule early in a project using the Basic Schedule Equation:

ScheduleMonths = 3.0 x StaffMonths^1/3

To use the equation, suppose you've estimated that you will need 80 staff months to build your project. The schedule computed from this formula ranges from 8.6 to 17.2 months depending on what coefficient from 2.0 to 4.0 is used. The nominal schedule will be (3.0 x 801/3), which is 12.9 months. (I don't recommend presenting the schedule estimate with this much precision; I'm including it here to make the calculations easier to follow.)

 Tip #89  Use the Basic Schedule Equation to estimate schedule early in medium-to-large projects.
 
The schedule equation is the reason that the uncertainty ranges in Figure 20-1 are much broader for efforts than they are for schedules. Effort increases in proportion to scope, whereas schedule increases in proportion to the cube root of effort.

The schedule equation implicitly assumes that you're able to adjust the team size to suit the size implied by the equation. If your team size is fixed, the schedule won't vary in proportion to the cube root of the scope; it will vary more widely based on your team-size constraints.

The Basic Schedule Equation is also not intended for estimation of small projects or late phases of larger projects. You should switch to some other technique when you know the names of the specific people working on the project.

Nominally, you can compute the average team size by taking the effort estimate and dividing it by the schedule. If you've estimated a 12-month schedule for a project of 80 staff months, your average team size is just the staff months divided by the schedule, 80 divided by 12, which is 6 to 7 team members.

The purpose of the schedule estimates in this chapter is not to predict your final schedule to the day but to provide a sanity check on your schedule-related plans. Once you've used schedule estimation to ensure that your plans are reasonable, detailed planning considerations (such as who is available when) will take precedence over the initial schedule estimation described.

 Tip #96  Use schedule estimation to ensure your plans are plausible. Use detailed planning to produce the final schedule.
