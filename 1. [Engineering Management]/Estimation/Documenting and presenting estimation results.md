Documenting and presenting estimation results
---

The way you communicate an estimate suggests how accurate the estimate is. If your presentation style implies an unfounded accuracy, you lay the groundwork for a difficult discussion about the estimate itself. This chapter presents several options for presenting estimates.

###Communicating Estimate Assumptions

An essential practice in presenting an estimate is to document the assumptions embodied in the estimate. Assumptions fall into several familiar categories:

  - Which features are required
  - Which features are not required
  - How elaborate certain features need to be
  - Availability of key resources
  - Dependencies on third-party performance
  - Major unknowns
  - Major influences and sensitivities of the estimate
  - How good the estimate is
  - What the estimate can be used for

Expressing Uncertainty
---

The key issue in estimate presentation is documenting the estimate's uncertainty in a way that communicates the uncertainty clearly and that also maximizes the chances that the estimate will be used constructively and appropriately. This section describes several ways to communicate uncertainty.
