[Scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(project_management))
----------------------------------------
In project management, the term scope has two distinct uses: **Project Scope** and **Product Scope**.

Scope involve getting information required to start a project, and the features the product would have that would meet its stakeholders requirements.

**Project Scope**
"The work that needs to be accomplished to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions."

**Product Scope**
"The features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result."
Notice that Project Scope is more work-oriented, (the hows,) while Product Scope is more oriented toward functional requirements. (the whats.)

If requirements aren't completely defined and described and if there is no effective change control in a project, scope or requirement creep may ensue.
