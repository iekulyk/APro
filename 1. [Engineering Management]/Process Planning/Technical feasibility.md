[Technical feasibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_feasibility)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application development projects often have limited budgets and constrained timelines, set by the stakeholders and upper management. These same people typically provide the business vision and funding for the project. They make decisions about which projects to execute based on both the business value of the resulting project and a professional developer’s estimate of the effort associated with the project. It is their confidence you need to gain before you will be trusted with the budget to execute the project. This means demonstrating that you understand the business problems you will be trying to solve and that you will be successful in translating their vision into tangible software before budgets and timelines are exhausted. To professional developers, this means reviewing requirements and recommending, evaluating, and refining a design for the application.


Evaluate the technical feasibility of an application design concept:
  - Evaluate the proof of concept
  - Recommend the best technologies for the features and goals of the application. Considerations include Message Queuing, Web         services, .NET Framework remoting, and so on
  - Weigh implementation considerations
  - Investigate existing solutions for similar business problems
  

------------------------------------------

  - Recognize poor requirements and propose improvements
  - Evaluate a set of application requirements for their completeness and feasibility
  - Recommend technologies based on a set of requirements
  - Investigate and evaluate existing alternatives to your recommendations
  - Define a high-level application design based on requirements and recommendations
  - Determine whether an application’s design is feasible and practical

you should be comfortable with all of the following tasks:

  - Reviewing goals and requirements for Web and/or Windows applications

  - Detailing the functional specifications for an application

  - Identifying how .NET architectures and related technologies solve specific business problems

  - Understanding distributed n-tier architectures

  - Working with object-oriented development concepts

  - Reading and working with class diagrams and other technical models

Not every problem should be solved with code or technology. As technologists, our first instinct to any problem might be to write some code. However, this is often not the best choice. Some problems are too costly in terms of dollars, resources, or time to implement. You need to take a step back and look at a problem not just as a developer but from the perspective of what is best for your organization. You will find that looking at problems with this attitude might change the way you would approach a specific solution. The results of this thinking are beneficial to the organization. However, it also shows your management that you see a bigger picture beyond just the technology and can be relied on to add business value.

When you are presented with a set of requirements, you need to be able to evaluate them and determine whether they are complete, feasible, and sufficient. The categories of requirements that must be present to make a complete set have already been mentioned: business, user, functional, and QOS. The following list represents criteria or questions that you can use to determine whether the requirements are sufficient.

   - **Requirement perspectives**   Are all requirement perspectives considered? Do you have a definition of the business, user, and QOS requirements? Can you derive the functional requirements and design from this set of requirements?

   - **Unambiguous**   Is each requirement written using specifics? Can each requirement be acted upon? You want to make sure that there are no unclear requirements. You want to eliminate phrases such as “the application should be easy to use” from the requirements. This is a goal. A requirement would indicate something such as “the application should implement a task pane of common user actions that are available for a given module.”

   - **Complete**   Are the requirements complete? You need to identify missing elements in the requirements. You should also indicate where further clarification of one or more requirements is warranted. Perhaps, for example, some requirements need further fleshing out through use cases. If you are having trouble understanding a requirement or designing to it, then it’s not complete.

   - **Necessary**   Are all the requirements actually necessary to satisfy the goals of the application? This is the opposite of complete. Sometimes business analysts, developers, and architects can add things to the system that are not really required. You need to watch for overzealous requirement definitions that inflate the scope of the project. 

   - **Feasible**   Are the requirements as documented really feasible? You need to review the requirements against known constraints such as budget, timeline, and technology. It’s better to raise red flags during the requirements definition phase than to wait until the project is already over budget.
