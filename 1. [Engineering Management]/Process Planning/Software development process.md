In software engineering, a software development methodology (also known as a system development methodology, 
software development life cycle, software development process, software process) is a splitting of software 
development work into distinct phases (or stages) containing activities with the intent of better planning and management. 
It is often considered a subset of the systems development life cycle. The methodology may include the pre-definition of 
specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application.[1]

Common methodologies include waterfall, prototyping, iterative and incremental development, spiral development, 
rapid application development, extreme programming and various types of agile methodology. Some people consider a 
life-cycle "model" a more general term for a category of methodologies and a software development "process" a more 
specific term to refer to a specific process chosen by a specific organization. For example, there are many specific software 
development processes that fit the spiral life-cycle model.
