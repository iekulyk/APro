Waterfall development
----------------------------------------------------------

The activities of the software development process represented in the waterfall model. There are several other models to represent this process.
The waterfall model is a sequential development approach, in which development is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through several phases, typically:

- Requirements analysis resulting in a software requirements specification
- Software design
- Implementation
- Testing
- Integration, if there are multiple subsystems
- Deployment (or Installation)
- Maintenance

The basic principles are:

- Project is divided into sequential phases, with some overlap and splashback acceptable between phases.
- Emphasis is on planning, time schedules, target dates, budgets and implementation of an entire system at one time.
- Tight control is maintained over the life of the project via extensive written documentation, formal reviews, and approval/signoff by the user and information technology management occurring at the end of most phases before beginning the next phase. Written documentation is an explicit deliverable of each phase.
- Iterate:- Create a prototype, then the real system. Repeat each phase using new information gained and the entire process at least once before delivering the live system.

Pros:
 - Time spent early in the software production cycle can reduce costs at later stages.
 - Robust and approved documentation
 
Cons:
  - Clients may not know exactly what their requirements are before they see working software and so change their requirements, leading to redesign, redevelopment, and retesting, and increased costs.
  - Designers may not be aware of future difficulties when designing a new software product or feature; in which case, it is better to revise the design than persist in a design that does not account for any newly discovered constraints, requirements, or problems.
