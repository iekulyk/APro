--------------------------------------------------
In Spiral model, software development takes place in series of developed releases. In initial stage iterations, the release or model might be a paper model or a prototype. In the later stages a more complete version of software is actually produced.

A spiral model is divided into number of framework activities, also called task regions. Every framework activities represent one section of the spiral path. As the development process starts, the software team perform activities that are indirect by a path around the spiral model in a clockwise direction. It begins at the center of spiral model.

Typically, there are between three and six task regions. The above figure depicts a spiral model that contains 6 task regions.

Phases Of Spiral Model (Tasks Regions)
---------------------------------------------------
  - Customer communication-tasks required to establish effective communication between developer and customer.
  - Planning-tasks required to define resources,timelines and other project related information.
  - Risk analysis tasks required to assess both technical and management risks.
  - Engineering tasks required to build one or more representations of the application.
  - Construction and release tasks required to construct ,test,install,and provide user support.
  - Customer evaluation-tasks required to obtain customer feedback based on evaluation of the software representations created during the     engineering stage and implemented during the installation stage.
  
Advantages Of Spiral Model
----------------------------------------------------
1. Estimates ( i.e budget, schedule, etc) become more realistic as work progresses, because more important issues are discovered  earlier.
2. It is more able to cope with the changes that software development generally entails.
3. Software engineers can get their hands in and start working on a project earlier.

Disadvantages Of Spiral Model
----------------------------------------------------
1. Highly customized limiting re-usability.
2. Applied differently for each application.
3. Risk of not meeting,budget or schedule.

Applications
----------------------------------------------------
  - The spiral model is mostly used in large projects. The military had adopted the spiral model for its Future Combat Systems program.
  - The spiral model thus may suit small software applications and not a complicated distributed, inter operable, system of systems.
  - It is also reasonable to use the spiral model in projects where business goals are unstable but the architecture must be realized     well enough to provide high loading and stress ability.
  - For example, the Spiral Architecture Driven Development is the spiral based Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) which shows one     possible way how to reduce the risk of non-effective architecture with the help of a in conjunction with the best practices from      other models.
