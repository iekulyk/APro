[Communications](http://www.continuousagile.com/unblock/team_communication.html)
------------------------------------
Your distributed team will need communication tools and techniques to replace the in-person chatter of a co-located team

**Skip the conference call**
Do not try to manage your distributed project with daily conference calls. People hate it. Think about a project where you participated in a lot of long conference calls. Did you enjoy it? Was it a satisfying, successful project?

They make the boss feel better by allowing him or her to share his or her problems. They don't solve problems for team members. They eat time that could be used to fix problems.

**Synchronous versus asynchronous**
"Synchronous" communications happen between two or more people at the same time. Face-to-face conversations are synchronous. Telephone calls are synchronous. In "asynchronous" communications, people can respond at different times, at their convenience. Emails and text messages are asynchronous communications.

A naive manager will try to replace his co-located conversations with equivalent, high-bandwidth, synchronous communications. This leads to a lot of conference calls, some of them late at night. It also leads to a vision of the future where everyone is in front of a camera, video-conferencing with colleagues as if they were at the next desk or in front of the proverbial water cooler.

However, many hard-working people prefer asynchronous communication. Even if they are sitting at the next desk, you will see that they often email each other and respond at leisure. This trend is particularly strong among young people who prefer to receive text messages rather than voice calls.

Why do they prefer short and seemingly unsatisfying text messages over real conversations with friends and colleagues? There are two reasons. First, they don't want to be interrupted. They want to pay attention to the thing in front of them, which is often computerized. Second, they are multitasking, having many different conversations at one time. At the same time that you are trying to talk to them about a weekly plan (bla bla bla) they are discussing an engineering point they care about, and arranging for beers with friends.

As we become more productive, and as the competition for our attention intensifies, we come to prefer asynchronous communications. Also, we get annoyed by people who demand our attention for synchronous meetings.

**Ticket and issue tracking systems**
Write your ideas, requests, bug reports, and comments in an online ticket system. They will be visible to the entire team, and you have a running, long-term record of contributions.

If you are writing feature requests, learn to present complete "stories." That makes the implementation work easier, and you will get better results.

A good online ticketing system with comments and attachments is a requirement for a distributed team.

**Email**
You should avoid using email for team communications. Information in an email thread is invisible for other team members. This creates work for you when you have to relay the information. When people email you details that are not important, they waste your time. When they email you information that is important, you need to repost it for the team, which wastes your time. Avoid becoming a human router. I recommend using email only if you are asking a personal question. If people send you information by email that they should be sharing, just ignore the information until they post it properly.

**Chat**
Every distributed team should have a chat running. People like chat because it can be synchronous when they want to have a real conversation, and asynchronous when they want to come back to it later. You want a persistent chat that team members can come back to at any time. You probably also want a searchable history so that you can find that URL someone posted last week. 

**Wiki and message boards**
You will want to post your documentation and instructions on a Wiki. If you are inviting new people to join the project, you should take some time to document the setup and other instructions. Later you will want to document test, build, and deploy procedures.

**Communicating with code**
An effective distributed programming team communicates with code. In fact, many of the most successful distributed projects are open source projects that communicate almost entirely through the exchange and review of code.
