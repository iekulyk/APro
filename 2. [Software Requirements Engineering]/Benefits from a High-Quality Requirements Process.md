Benefits from a High-Quality Requirements Process
---

Organizations that implement effective requirements engineering processes can reap multiple benefits. A great reward comes from reducing unnecessary rework during the late development stages and throughout the lengthy maintenance period. The high leveraging effect of quality requirements isn't obvious, and many people mistakenly believe that time spent discussing requirements simply delays delivery by the same duration. A holistic cost-of-quality perspective reveals the value of emphasizing early-stage quality practices (Wiegers 1996a). 

Sound requirements processes emphasize a collaborative approach to product development that involves multiple stakeholders in a partnership throughout the project. Collecting requirements enables the development team to better understand its user community or market, a critical success factor for any project. It's far cheaper to reach this understanding before you build the product than after your customers receive it.

Engaging users in the requirements-gathering process generates enthusiasm for the product and builds customer loyalty. By emphasizing user tasks instead of superficially attractive features, the team can avoid writing code that won't ever be used. Customer involvement reduces the expectation gap between what the user needs and what the developer delivers. You're going to get the customer feedback eventually. Try to get it early rather than late, perhaps with the help of prototypes that stimulate user feedback. Requirements development takes time, but it takes less time than correcting a lot of problems in beta testing or after release.

There are additional benefits, too. Explicitly allocating selected system requirements to various software, hardware, and human subsystems emphasizes a systems approach to product engineering. An effective change-control process will minimize the adverse impact of requirements changes. Documented, unambiguous requirements greatly facilitate system testing, which in turn increases your chances of delivering high-quality products that satisfy all stakeholders.

No one can promise a specific return on investment from an improved requirements process. You can go through an analytical thought process to imagine how better requirements could help you, though. First, consider the cost of investing in a better process. This includes the cost of assessing your current practices, developing new procedures and document templates, training the team, buying books and tools, and perhaps using outside consultants. Your greatest investment is the time your teams spend gathering, documenting, reviewing, and managing their requirements. Next, think about the possible benefits you might enjoy and how much time or money they could save you. It's impossible to quantify all the following benefits, but they are real:
  - Fewer requirements defects
  - Reduced development rework
  - Fewer unnecessary features
  - Lower enhancement costs
  - Faster development
  - Fewer miscommunications
  - Reduced scope creep
  - Reduced project chaos
  - More accurate system-testing estimates
  - Higher customer and team member satisfaction
