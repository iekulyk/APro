System requirements
---

The term system requirements describes the top-level requirements for a product that contains multiple subsystemsâ€”that is, a system (IEEE 1998c). A system can be all software or it can include both software and hardware subsystems. People are a part of a system, too, so certain system functions might be allocated to human beings.
