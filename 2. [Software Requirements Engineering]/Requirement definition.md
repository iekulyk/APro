Requirement definition
---

One problem with the software industry is the lack of common definitions for terms we use to describe aspects of our work. Different observers might describe the same statement as being a user requirement, software requirement, functional requirement, system requirement, technical requirement, business requirement, or product requirement. A customer's definition of requirements might sound like a high-level product concept to the developer. The developer's notion of requirements might sound like detailed user interface design to the user. This diversity of definitions leads to confusing and frustrating communication problems.

A key concept is that the requirements must be documented. I was on a project once that had experienced a rotating cast of developers. The primary customer was sick to tears of having each new requirements analyst come along and say, "We have to talk about your requirements." The customer's reaction was, "I already gave your predecessors the requirements. Now build me a system!" In reality, no one had ever documented the requirements, so every new analyst had to start from scratch. To proclaim that you have the requirements is delusional if all you really have is a pile of e-mail and voice-mail messages, sticky notes, meeting minutes, and vaguely recollected hallway conversations.

####Some Interpretations of Requirement

Consultant Brian Lawrence suggests that a requirement is "anything that drives design choices".
Many kinds of information fit in this category.

The IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology (1990) defines a requirement as:
  - A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective.
  - A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document.
  - A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 or 2.
  

Requirements areâ€¦a specification of what should be implemented. They are descriptions of how the system should behave, or of a system property or attribute. They may be a constraint on the development process of the system.
