Product Vision and Scope document

---

The vision and scope document collects the business requirements into a single document that sets the stage for the subsequent development work. Some organizations create a project charter or a business case document that serves a similar purpose. Organizations that build commercial software often create a market requirements document

###Product Scope

As per the PMBOK Guide 5th edition, the product scope is the features and functions that characterize product, service or result.

So you can say that the product scope is all about the product itself. The product scope defines what the product will look like, how will it work, its features, etc.

For example, if the product is a bridge, the product scope might be its length, width, load strength, etc.

####How to Determine the Product Scope?

Most of the time, determining the product scope is not a difficult task. If you get a project through a contract, you will get the product scope with the contract. However, if the project is initiated by your organization, you will have to define the product scope after consulting with relevant stakeholders.

It is very important for you to determine the product scope before determining the project scope. You must have a clearly defined product scope in order to develop a well-defined project scope.

The product scope binds you and your organization to the client. You should make every effort to get this specification clear and complete from the client, otherwise you might face major issues in the later stages of the project. A slight change in the product scope can cost you a lot more money than a change in the project scope statement.

The owner of the vision and scope document is the project's executive sponsor, funding authority, or someone in a similar role. A requirements analyst can work with the owner to write the vision and scope document. Input on the business requirements should come from individuals who have a clear sense of why they are undertaking the project. These individuals might include the customer or development organization's senior management, a project visionary, a product manager, a subject matter expert, or members of the marketing department.

suggests a template for a vision and scope document. Document templates standardize the structure of the documents created by your organization's project teams. As with any template, adapt this one to meet the specific needs of your own projects.

###Project Scope

According to the PMBOK Guide 5th edition, the project scope is the work performed to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions.

The project scope is all about the project. It defines the requirement of the product and the work required to create the product. It also defines what is in the scope and what not, to avoid the scope creep.

The project scope statement explains the result of your project and includes the constraints and assumptions under which you will have to work. It includes everything you need to do to ensure the product scope is achieved. The project scope is also known as scope statement or statement of the work.

####How to Determine the Project Scope?

The answer to this question is: It depends.

For example, if you have gotten a firm fixed price contract, the client will give you a very well-defined product description, which helps you in developing the project scope statement. In this case you won’t have to worry too much about the project scope.

Let’s consider another case. Here, your organization initiates a project and you have been authorized as a project manager. In this case, you may have to build the project scope statement from scratch. You will contact relevant stakeholders to collect the requirements and compile it, and then get it approved from the management.

A well written scope statement makes your life much easier and you can complete the project with fewer hurdles. The project scope is an agreement between you and the client or your organization.

The project scope binds you and your project team to your organization; therefore it should be very lucid and clear. You must try to get this document as detailed as possible and at a very early stage of the project. An effective scope statement is necessary to guide a project to a successful completion.

Determining the project scope is the first step in establishing the project, its schedule, budget, and resource allocation. Once you finish writing the project scope, you can make the plan, distribute tasks and guide your team so that you can complete the project on time, on budget, and deliver the product of the project.

I hope now you have understand the concept of the product scope and the project scope.

If not, don’t worry; keep on reading.

Now it is time to explain this to you with our trademark school building example.

You get a project to construc a school building. The client gives you his requirements, such as the size of the school building, numbers of rooms, details of the playground, number of toilets, paint color, etc.

You start working on the project. You estimate the budget, develop the plan and create the schedule.

After developing and approving the plan, you will assemble the team and move on to the execution part. You bring workers to the site and start constructing the school building. You complete the construction of the school building and then verify with the client whether the school building is as per his requirements.

Once the client inspects and is satisfied with his requirements, you hand the school building over to him, get the final payment, and the project is closed.

In the above example there are two parts. In the first part, the client asks you to make a school building for him and gives you his requirements (characteristics). This school building is the “product” and his requirements are the “scope”. Therefore, what he gave you is, in fact, the “product scope”.

In the second part, you work to construct the school building within the given time and budget, and meeting all the client’s requirements by following the project management plans. Lastly, you deliver it to the client. In this part, what work you have done to construct the school building is the “project scope”.
