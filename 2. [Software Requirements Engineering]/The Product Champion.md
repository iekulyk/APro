The Product Champion

---

Many years ago I worked in a small software development group that supported the scientific research activities at a major corporation. Each of our projects included a few key members of our user community to provide the requirements. We called these people product champions (or project champions, although that term more often refers to the management sponsors of a project) (Wiegers 1996a). The product champion approach provides an effective way to structure the customer-development partnership.

###Watch out for user managers or for software developers who think they already understand the needs of the real system users without asking.

Each product champion serves as the primary interface between members of a single user class and the project's requirements analyst. Ideally, the champions will be actual users, not surrogates such as funding sponsors, procuring customers, marketing staff, user managers, or software developers pretending to be users. Product champions collect requirements from other members of the user classes they represent and reconcile inconsistencies. Requirements development is thus a shared responsibility of the analysts and selected customers, although the analyst writes the requirements documents.

The best product champions have a clear vision of the new system and are enthusiastic about it because they see how it will benefit them and their peers. The champions should be effective communicators who are respected by their colleagues. They need a thorough understanding of the application domain and the system's operating environment. Great product champions are in demand for other assignments on their principal job, so you'll have to build a persuasive case for why particular individuals are critical to project success. My team and I found that good product champions made a huge difference in our projects, so we happily offered them public reward and recognition for their contributions.

The product champion approach works best if each champion is fully empowered to make binding decisions on behalf of the user class he represents. If a champion's decisions are routinely overruled by managers or by the software group, the champion's time and goodwill are being wasted. However, the champions must remember that they are not the sole customers. Problems arise when the individual filling this critical liaison role doesn't adequately communicate with his peers and presents only his own wishes and ideas.

###External Product Champions

When developing commercial software, it can be difficult to find people to serve as product champions from outside your company. If you have a close working relationship with some major corporate customers, they might welcome the opportunity to participate in requirements elicitation. You might give external product champions economic incentives for their participation. Consider offering them discounts on products or paying for the time they spend working with you on requirements. You still face the challenge of how to avoid hearing only the champions' requirements and neglecting the needs of other customers. If you have a diverse customer base, first identify core requirements that are common to all customers. Then define additional requirements that are specific to individual customers, market segments, or user classes.

Any time the product champion is a former or simulated user, watch out for disconnects between the champion's perceptions and the current needs of real users. Some problem domains change rapidly and some are more stable. The medical field is evolving quickly, whereas many corporate business processes persist in similar form for years. The essential question is whether the product champion, no matter what his background or current job, can accurately represent the needs of real users.

###Product Champion Expectations

To help the product champion approach succeed, document what you expect your champions to do. These written expectations can help you build a case for specific individuals to fill this critical role.

  - Planning
    - Refine the scope and limitations of the product 
    - Define interfaces to other systems
    - Evaluate impact of new system on business operations
    - Define a transition path from current applications
  - Requirements
    - Collect requirements from other users 
    - Develop usage scenarios and use cases
    - Resolve conflicts between proposed requirements
    - Define implementation priorities
    - Specify quality and performance requirements
    - Evaluate user interface prototypes
  - Validation and Verification
    - Inspect requirements documents 
    - Define user acceptance criteria
    - Develop test cases from usage scenarios
    - Provide test data sets
    - Perform beta testing
  - User Aids
    - Write portions of user manuals and help text 
    - Prepare training materials for tutorials
    - Present product demonstrations to peers
  - Change Management
    - Evaluate and prioritize defect corrections 
    - Prepare training materials for tutorials
    - Evaluate the impact of proposed requirements changes on users and business processes
    - Participate in making change decisions

###Multiple Product Champions

One person can rarely describe the needs for all users of an application. The Chemical Tracking System had four major user classes, so it needed four product champions selected from the internal user community at Contoso Pharmaceuticals.
These champions were not assigned full-time, but each one spent several hours per week working on the project. Three analysts worked with the four product champions to elicit, analyze, and document their requirements. (The same analyst worked with two product champions because the Buyer and the Health and Safety Department user classes were small and had few requirements.) One analyst assembled all the input into a single SRS.

One person cannot adequately supply all the diverse requirements for a large user class such as the hundreds of chemists at Contoso. To help him, the product champion for the chemist user class assembled a backup team of five other chemists from other parts of the company. These chemists represented subclasses within the broad "chemist" user class. This hierarchical approach engaged additional users in requirements development while avoiding the expense of massive workshops or dozens of individual interviews. The chemist product champion, Don, always strove for consensus, but he willingly made the necessary decisions when agreement wasn't achieved so that the project could move ahead instead of deadlocking. No backup team was necessary when the user class was small enough or cohesive enough that one individual could adequately represent the group's needs.

###Selling the Product Champion Idea

Expect to encounter resistance when you propose the idea of having product champions on your projects. "The users are too busy." "Management wants to make the decisions." "They'll slow us down." "We can't afford it." "I don't know what I'm supposed to do as a product champion." Some users won't want to provide input on a system that they fear will make them change the way they work or might threaten their job with elimination. Managers are sometimes reluctant to delegate authority for requirements to ordinary users.

Separating business requirements from user requirements alleviates these discomforts. As an actual user, the product champion makes decisions at the user requirements level within the constraints that the project's business requirements impose. The management sponsor retains the authority to make decisions that affect the product vision, project scope, schedule, and cost. Documenting and negotiating the product champion's role and responsibilities give candidate champions a comfort level about what they're being asked to do.

If you encounter resistance, point out that insufficient user involvement is well established as a leading cause of software project failure (The Standish Group 1995). Remind the protesters of problems they've experienced on previous projects that trace back to inadequate user involvement. Every organization has horror stories of new systems that didn't satisfy user needs or failed to meet unstated usability or performance expectations. You can't afford to rebuild or discard systems that don't measure up because no one understood the requirements. Product champions mitigate this risk.

###Product Champion Traps to Avoid

The product champion model has succeeded in many environments. It works only when the product champion understands and signs up for his responsibilities, has the authority to make decisions at the user requirements level, and has the time to do the job. Watch out for the following potential problems:

  - Some managers override the decisions that a qualified and duly authorized product champion makes. Perhaps the manager has a wild new idea at the last minute, wants to change the project direction at a whim, or thinks he knows what the users need. This behavior often results in dissatisfied users, late deliveries as the developers chase the latest management notion, and frustrated product champions who feel that management doesn't trust them.
  - A product champion who forgets that he is representing other customers and presents only his own requirements won't do a good job. He might be happy with the outcome, but others likely won't be.
  - A senior user might nominate a less experienced user as champion because he doesn't have time to do the job himself. This can lead to backseat driving from the senior user who still wishes to strongly influence the project's direction.
