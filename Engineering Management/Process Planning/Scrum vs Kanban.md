**When We Choose Kanban**
In agile, Kanban is the de facto choice for maintenance-type projects where Scrum might be too rigid.

For example, if you’re running a network-ops organization and a network switch dies on a Thursday, you can’t say, “We’re already working on a sprint, so we will take a look at it next week –  you’ll have your fix in 3 weeks.” In these situations, Scrum creates more stress and headaches while Kanban’s flexibility allows you to pull down prioritized tasks immediately and work on urgent matters.

Kanban let us tackle customer service issues the moment they arrived without grief and helped us grow our team without putting project goals at risk. It helped us achieve success when priorities could change at a moment’s notice.
