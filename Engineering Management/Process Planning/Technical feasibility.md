[Technical feasibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_feasibility)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application development projects often have limited budgets and constrained timelines, set by the stakeholders and upper management. These same people typically provide the business vision and funding for the project. They make decisions about which projects to execute based on both the business value of the resulting project and a professional developer’s estimate of the effort associated with the project. It is their confidence you need to gain before you will be trusted with the budget to execute the project. This means demonstrating that you understand the business problems you will be trying to solve and that you will be successful in translating their vision into tangible software before budgets and timelines are exhausted. To professional developers, this means reviewing requirements and recommending, evaluating, and refining a design for the application.


Evaluate the technical feasibility of an application design concept:
  - Evaluate the proof of concept
  - Recommend the best technologies for the features and goals of the application. Considerations include Message Queuing, Web         services, .NET Framework remoting, and so on
  - Weigh implementation considerations
  - Investigate existing solutions for similar business problems


  - Recognize poor requirements and propose improvements
  - Evaluate a set of application requirements for their completeness and feasibility
  - Recommend technologies based on a set of requirements
  - Investigate and evaluate existing alternatives to your recommendations
  - Define a high-level application design based on requirements and recommendations
  - Determine whether an application’s design is feasible and practical

Technical feasibility is one of the first studies that must be conducted after the project has been identified. In large engineering projects consulting agencies that have large staffs of engineers and technicians conduct technical studies dealing with the projects.

**Method of Production**
The selection among a number of methods to produce the same commodity should be undertaken first. Factors that make one method being preferred to other method

**Production Technique**
After we determine the appropriate method of production of a commodity, it is necessary to look for the optimal technique to produce this commodity.

**Project Requirements**
Once the method of production and its technique are determined, technical people have to determine the projects' requirements during the investment and operating periods.

The aim of the Technical Feasibility Grant is to support the cost of a company to undertake a technical study into;

the development of new products, technologies, processes or internationally traded services.  
the improvement/redesign or development of existing products, services or processes.
the viability of extending or expanding company facilities to meet increased operational capacity needs.
investigating the potential or application of new technologies or licensing in new technologies.

Typical elements involved in carrying out a feasibility study include:

  - Prototyping and design
  - Manufacturing process assessment
  - Plant evaluation and selection
  - Raw material sourcing
  - Cost analysis
  - Negotiating with potential joint 
  - Market research
