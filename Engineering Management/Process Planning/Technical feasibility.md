[Technical feasibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_feasibility)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical feasibility is one of the first studies that must be conducted after the project has been identified. In large engineering projects consulting agencies that have large staffs of engineers and technicians conduct technical studies dealing with the projects.

**Method of Production**
The selection among a number of methods to produce the same commodity should be undertaken first. Factors that make one method being preferred to other method

**Production Technique**
After we determine the appropriate method of production of a commodity, it is necessary to look for the optimal technique to produce this commodity.

**Project Requirements**
Once the method of production and its technique are determined, technical people have to determine the projects' requirements during the investment and operating periods.

The aim of the Technical Feasibility Grant is to support the cost of a company to undertake a technical study into;

the development of new products, technologies, processes or internationally traded services.  
the improvement/redesign or development of existing products, services or processes.
the viability of extending or expanding company facilities to meet increased operational capacity needs.
investigating the potential or application of new technologies or licensing in new technologies.

Typical elements involved in carrying out a feasibility study include:

  - Prototyping and design
  - Manufacturing process assessment
  - Plant evaluation and selection
  - Raw material sourcing
  - Cost analysis
  - Negotiating with potential joint 
  - Market research
