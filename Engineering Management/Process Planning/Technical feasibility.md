[Technical feasibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_feasibility)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application development projects often have limited budgets and constrained timelines, set by the stakeholders and upper management. These same people typically provide the business vision and funding for the project. They make decisions about which projects to execute based on both the business value of the resulting project and a professional developer’s estimate of the effort associated with the project. It is their confidence you need to gain before you will be trusted with the budget to execute the project. This means demonstrating that you understand the business problems you will be trying to solve and that you will be successful in translating their vision into tangible software before budgets and timelines are exhausted. To professional developers, this means reviewing requirements and recommending, evaluating, and refining a design for the application.


Evaluate the technical feasibility of an application design concept:
  - Evaluate the proof of concept
  - Recommend the best technologies for the features and goals of the application. Considerations include Message Queuing, Web         services, .NET Framework remoting, and so on
  - Weigh implementation considerations
  - Investigate existing solutions for similar business problems
  - 

------------------------------------------

  - Recognize poor requirements and propose improvements
  - Evaluate a set of application requirements for their completeness and feasibility
  - Recommend technologies based on a set of requirements
  - Investigate and evaluate existing alternatives to your recommendations
  - Define a high-level application design based on requirements and recommendations
  - Determine whether an application’s design is feasible and practical
