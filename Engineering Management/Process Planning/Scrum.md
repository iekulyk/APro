[Scrum](http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v1/scrum-guide-us.pdf) [*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))
------------------------------------------------------

Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development methodology for managing product development. It defines "a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal", challenges assumptions of the "traditional, sequential approach" to product development, and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines in the project.

A key principle of scrum is its recognition that during production processes, the customers can change their minds about what they want and need (often called requirements volatility), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner. As such, scrum adopts an empirical approach—accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.

Scrum Events
----------------------------------
- **Sprint Planning** - The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by
the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

  Sprint Planning answers the following:
    - What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
    - How will the chosen work get done?

- **Daily Scrum** - The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize
  activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. This is done by inspecting the work since the
  last Daily Scrum and forecasting the work that could be done before the next one. The Daily
  Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity. During the meeting,
  the Development Team members explain:
    
    - What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
    - What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
    - Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the
      Sprint Goal?


- **Sprint Review** - A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product
    Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate
    about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog
    during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value.
    This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is
    intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.
    
    The Sprint Review includes the following elements:
      - Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner
      - The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been “Done” and what
        has not been “Done”
      - The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it
        ran into, and how those problems were solved;
      - The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers
        questions about the Increment;
      - The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely
        completion dates based on progress to date
      - The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides
        valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning;
      - Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed
        what is the most valuable thing to do next
      - Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next
        anticipated release of the product

- **Sprint Retrospective** - The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan
for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

  The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:
    - Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and
      tools
    - Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; 
    - Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its
      work.


- Extensions :
  - **Backlog grooming/refinement** - is the ongoing process of reviewing product backlog items and checking that they are appropriately prioritised and prepared in a way that makes them clear and executable for teams once they enter sprints via the sprint planning activity.
  
  - **Scrum Of Scrums** - The scrum of scrums is a technique to scale scrum up for multiple teams working on the same product, allowing teams to discuss progress on their interdependencies, focusing on how to coordinate delivering software, especially on areas of overlap and integration.

Scrum Team 
---------------------------------------
- **Product Owner** - The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog; Clearly expressing Product Backlog items; Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs; Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level
needed

- **Development Team** - They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team
how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality; Development Teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create
a product Increment;Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer,
regardless of the work being performed by the person; there are no exceptions to this rule;Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of particular domains
that need to be addressed like testing or business analysis; there are no exceptions to this
rule; Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but
accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.


- **Scrum Master** - Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management;Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
UnderstaUnderstanding and practicing agility;nding product planning in an empirical environment;Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value;
Understanding and practicing agility;Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.

  Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality;
  Helping the Development Team to create high-value products;
  Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress;
  Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed; 
  Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood


Artifacts
-------------------------------------
- **Product Backlog** - The product backlog comprises an ordered list of requirements that a scrum team maintains for a product. It consists of features, bug fixes, non-functional requirements, etc.—whatever must be done to successfully deliver a viable product. The product owner orders the product backlog items (PBIs) based on considerations such as risk, business value, dependencies, and date needed.

- **Sprint Backlog** - The sprint backlog is the list of work the development team must address during the next sprint. The list is derived by the scrum team selecting product backlog items from the top of the product backlog until the development team feels it has enough work to fill the sprint. 

- **Product increment** - The increment (or potentially shippable increment, PSI) is the sum of all the product backlog items completed during a sprint and all previous sprints. At the end of a sprint, the increment must be complete, according to the scrum team's Definition of Done (DoD), and in a usable condition regardless of whether the product owner decides to actually release it.

- **Sprint** - A time period (typically 1–4 weeks) in which development occurs on a set of backlog items that the team has committed to—commonly referred to as a time-box or iteration

- **Tasks** - Work items added to the sprint backlog at the beginning of a sprint and broken down into hours. Each task should not exceed 12 hours (or two days), but it's common for teams to insist that a task take no more than a day to finish.

- **User Story** - is a description consisting of one or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function.

- **Epic** - big user story

[Estimation](http://scrumorakel.de/blog/index.php?/archives/48-Estimating-relative-sizes-e.g.-story-points.html)
---------------------------------------------
- **Velocity** - The total effort a team is capable of in a sprint. The number is derived by evaluating the work (typically in user story points) completed from the last sprint's backlog items. The collection of historical velocity data is a guideline for assisting the team in understanding how much work they can do in a future sprint.

- **Sprint Burndown Chart** - Daily progress for a sprint over the sprint's length.

- **Feature Burndown Chart** - Feature level progress of completed product backlog items in the product backlog.
