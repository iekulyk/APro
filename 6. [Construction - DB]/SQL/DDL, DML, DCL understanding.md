DDL, DML, DCL understanding

###DDL

Data Definition Language (DDL) is a standard for commands that define the different structures in a database. DDL statements create, modify, and remove database objects such as tables, indexes, and users. Common DDL statements are CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.

###DML

DML statements are SQL statements that manipulate data. DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. The SQL statements that are in the DML class are INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE. Some people also lump the SELECT statement in the DML classification.
Performing read-only queries of data is sometimes also considered a component of DML.

###DCL

A data control language (DCL) is a syntax similar to a computer programming language used to control access to data stored in a database (Authorization). In particular, it is a component of Structured Query Language (SQL).

Examples of DCL commands include:
  - GRANT to allow specified users to perform specified tasks.
  - REVOKE to cancel previously granted or denied permissions.
