Relational terminology
---

The entire structure is, as we've said, a relation. Each row of data is a tuple (rhymes with "couple"). Actually, each row is an n-tuple, but the "n-" is usually dropped. The number of tuples in a relation determines its cardinality. In this case, the relation has a cardinality of 11. Each column in the tuple is called an attribute. The number of attributes in a relation determines its degree.
