SOLID 
---

The Single Responsibility Principle  - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

The Open Closed Principle -	You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it

The Liskov Substitution Principle -	Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

The Interface Segregation Principle -	Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.

The Dependency Inversion Principle -	Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
