[**Abstraction**](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24626/abstraction-vs-information-hiding-vs-encapsulation/8694874#8694874)
---------------------------------
Abstraction and encapsulation are complementary concepts: abstraction focuses on the observable behavior of an object... encapsulation focuses upon the implementation that gives rise to this behavior... encapsulation is most often achieved through information hiding, which is the process of hiding all of the secrets of object that do not contribute to its essential characteristics.

In other words: abstraction = the object externally; encapsulation (achieved through information hiding) = the object internally

An abstraction is a simplified description of a system which captures the essential elements of that system (from the perspective of the needs of the modeler) while suppressing all other elements.
The boundary of the abstraction must be well-defined so that other abstractions may rely on it. This cooperation between abstractions relies on the contract of responsibilities that an abstraction provides. This relationship is sometimes called client and server.
