**Separation of Concerns (SoC)** – is the process of breaking a computer program into distinct features that overlap in functionality as little as possible. A concern is any piece of interest or focus in a program. Typically, concerns are synonymous with features or behaviors.

SoC is not limited to Architecture Layers, it’s also applied on many other things, such as:  an object that could represent a concern from language point view, SOA can separate concerns into services, separating behaviour as concern in logical units, etc...
