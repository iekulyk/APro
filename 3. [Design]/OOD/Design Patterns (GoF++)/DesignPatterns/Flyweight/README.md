Intent

---

- Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
- The Motif GUI strategy of replacing heavy-weight widgets with light-weight gadgets

Problem

---

Designing objects down to the lowest levels of system "granularity" provides optimal flexibility, but can be unacceptably expensive in terms of performance and memory usage.
